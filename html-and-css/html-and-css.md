# Cheat Sheet #

## Headings ##

* We have 6 types of headings.
* The biggest heading is ```<h1>```.
  * The second biggest heading is ```<h2>``` and so on until ```<h6>```.
 
## Paragraphs ##

* The ```<p>``` element will just show plain text.

## White Space Collapsing ##

* HTML ignores wide empty spaces.
 
## Image Basics ##

* ```<img src="" alt="">``` the ```src``` attribute is where you type the location of the picture. The ```alt``` attribute is a text which appears when hovering over the image. ```alt``` is very important for blind users as they hear the text via 3rd party softwares.
 * Attributes describe HTML elements.

## Multiple Images ##

* When referencing a ```src```, proper syntax is ```src="./image.png"``` or ```src="./folder/image.png"```.
 * We have the ```./``` because we would like to state it as a relative path for future React or Angular usage.

## External Images ##

* For external images (images which are imported from the web) you need to paste the image URL in the ```src``` attribute.

## Nice Images ##

* For commercial use, we must use allowed photos from various websites like [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/), [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/) and [gratisography.com](https://gratisography.com/)
